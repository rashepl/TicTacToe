This is a list of tasks this software will eventually perform:

* gameplay against the computer (artificial intelligence)
* track the number of wins/losses for each player
* allow users to customize the colors of the game board/characters
* allow users to choose which types of characters to use: Ex. "X" could be "$" instead
* include a timer and track wins by time
* allow users to create a custom sized grid: Ex. instead of the simple 3X3 grid, allow a user to play on a 4X4 grid
* provide the ability to save an in-progress game
* allow the characters used to resize within the grid
* add an option to open a new game on start-up
* prompt the user when closing an in-progress game if the game is to be saved
* include an undo move capability
